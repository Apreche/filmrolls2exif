Take the XML from the iOS Film Rolls app and apply it as Exif data to a directoy full of jpgs. 

The Film Rolls app for iOS allows a photographer to manually record metadata pertaining to analog photos while in the field. It also allows user to access this data in the form of an XML file. What it does not provide is a mechanism to take that XML data and put it into the Exif metadata fields on the jpgs. That is what this application does.

Here is the link to the excellent Film Rolls iOS app
